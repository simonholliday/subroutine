"""The browser app — item `#597`.

Two things nothing else in this suite can check.

**Its licences**, because ``scripts/check_licences.py`` walks ``importlib.metadata`` and is
structurally blind to a JavaScript file copied into the package. `#445` recorded that as the
argument against a build step and an npm closure, and the same hole opens for three files as
for three hundred.

**That its templates render.** htm is a *tagged template literal*, so a malformed template
parses perfectly and throws when it is rendered — which is a blank page for the reader and a
green build for us. Syntax checking cannot see it; only rendering can.
