"""The MCP server: the wire, and the tools on it.

Two halves tested apart, because they can be wrong independently. The protocol tests use
tools that do arithmetic, so a failure means the *messages* are wrong; the tool tests drive
a real client against a real database, so a failure means *Subroutine* is wrong.

The message shapes here were taken from the published specification (2025-06-18) rather than
from memory, and the ones that are easy to get wrong are asserted rather than assumed: a
notification gets no answer at all, and a tool that fails is a successful response carrying

	endpoint spends the benefit before earning it. The arguments here lean on grammars that
	already exist, which is what keeps the schemas small.

	**The numbers are a budget, not a description**, and raising one is meant to be an act
	rather than a shrug. Raised twice:

	- **2026-07-31, 6 tools / 4,096 -> 7 / 4,608**, for ``subroutine_document`` (`#138`).
	  ``subroutine_comment`` already told agents "for a conclusion the next session needs,
	  write a document instead" while no tool could. Measured at 764 bytes against 557 of
	  headroom before the cap moved.
	- **2026-08-01, 7 / 4,608 -> 9 / 6,144**, for `#149`, and the case is worth keeping
	  because it is the first time the budget was weighed against a *measured* alternative
	  rather than against a preference.

	  `#146` measured all three surfaces: an agent could not search, could not defer, could
	  not say what blocks what, could not ask what was on today, and could not make or list a
	  project. Four of those are not thinness, they are contradictions — ``subroutine_list``
	  offers ``ready=true``, which filters on exactly the links the agent could not create,
	  and decision `#96` says an external wait *is* a defer the agent could not set.

	  **The alternative was not free, which is what settles it.** The skill was already
	  telling agents to shell out to the CLI for three of these, so the cost was being paid
	  in Bash calls and in skill text every session — and paid by the agent least able to
	  recover when the shell-out failed. 4,428 -> 6,111 bytes is roughly 1,100 -> 1,530
	  tokens: about 430 more per session, against five capabilities and a workaround the
	  skill no longer has to teach.

	  **Fat was read for first, and there was less than expected.** ``update``'s description
	  lost 90 bytes of priority teaching that belongs in the skill. The ``workspace``
	  property, nine identical copies costing 434 bytes, was named once in the source — which
	  stops it drifting and **saves nothing on the wire**, because the dict is serialised in
	  full each time. Only ``$defs`` would cut it, and a client that does not resolve a
	  reference would show a property with no description at all.

	The slack above the current total is deliberate and small — **7 bytes** as this is written,
	which is less than one word. A cap set exactly at what is there makes every addition a cap
	change, which is theatre; a generous one stops being a budget.

	**That number is now stated as of a date, because the last one rotted.** It said 33 bytes,
	which was true when it was written and was 7 by the time anybody read it again — a title
	stating a condition becomes false when the condition changes, silently, which is the
	argument `#139` settled about item titles and applies to a comment just as well (`#198`).
	Do not trust it; run the test and read what it says.
